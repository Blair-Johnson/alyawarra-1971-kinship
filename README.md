# Alyawarra 1971 Kinship Data
Ethnographic data describing the Alyawarra-speaking Aboriginal people of central Austraila collected from 1971-1972 by Woodrow Denham. This is the source data for the [Kinships Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/kinships) commonly used in knowledge graph completion benchmarks.

## Purpose
The Kinships dataset is commonly used, but the context and source data for the benchmark is challenging to find online. I've re-uploaded it here from the (currently down as of Oct. 2023) Kinsources.net database. A paper describing the history of this dataset in machine learning research can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350788238_Artificial_Intelligence_Machine_Learning_Research_Using_the_Australian_Aboriginal_Alyawarra_Kinship_Dataset_Partial_Bibliography_2004-2020), and additional resources can be found in the publication section of the author's [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Woodrow-Denham).

## Ethics and Informed-Consent
Historically, western research on indigenous peoples has been ethically frought. The original author of this data, Denham, has written a document outlining his views and recollection about the circumstances of this data collection. You can read that document [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350790427_Expanded_Access_Restrictions). As this data was collected over 50 years ago, it is challenging to find additional context beyond that from Denham. If anyone has additional information about the ethics or context of this dataset I encourage them to share it as a GitHub issue.
